# Amazon Data Analysis Framework

## Overview
This repository provides a Python framework to analyze Amazon's SQP Report and Business Report data. The goal is to identify low-performing ASINs (low CTR), provide actionable insights, and estimate revenue opportunities under various scenarios of CTR and CVR improvement.

## Features
### Keyword-Level Metrics:
- Analyze click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate (CVR) at the keyword level.
- Simulate revenue growth under different CTR and CVR improvement scenarios.

### ASIN-Level Metrics:
- Aggregate data at the ASIN level for overall performance evaluation.
- Include comparisons of CTR against benchmarks (Click Rate % and Share %).

### CTR & CVR Opportunity Matrix:
- Generate an annual revenue impact matrix for low CTR ASINs.
- Estimate revenue growth based on combinations of CTR and CVR improvements.

### Low CTR ASIN Analysis Table:
- Provide keyword-specific recommendations for:
  - Keyword Optimization
  - PPC Ad Campaigns
  - Content Improvements
  - Pricing and Promotions

## Input Files
- **SQP Report.csv**: Contains keyword-level metrics like impressions, clicks, CTR, CVR, and purchase data.
- **Business Report.csv**: Contains session-level and revenue data for parent and child ASINs.

## Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/WesDEV-2024/amz-Frameworks.git
cd amz-Frameworks
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas ace_tools
Ensure the input files (SQP Report.csv and Business Report.csv) are in the same directory as the script.

Usage
Run the script amazon_data_analysis.py to generate the following outputs:

Keyword Level Metrics:
Detailed insights into CTR and CVR by ASIN and keyword.
Scenario-based incremental sales estimates.
ASIN Level Metrics:
Aggregated performance metrics for each ASIN.
CTR & CVR Opportunity Matrix for Low CTR ASINs:
Annual revenue impact estimates for combinations of CTR and CVR improvements.
Low CTR ASIN Analysis Table:
Keyword-specific recommendations for improving low-performing ASINs.

Recommendations
Keyword Optimization: Improve targeting and relevance for keywords associated with low CTR ASINs.
PPC Ad Campaigns: Increase traffic to low CTR ASINs via paid advertising.
Content Improvements: Optimize product titles, bullet points, and images to enhance engagement.
Pricing and Offers: Evaluate pricing strategies and promotions to improve CTR and CVR simultaneously.
Full Python Code
The Python script is available in the repository: amazon_data_analysis.py. It generates all the above outputs using data from SQP Report.csv and Business Report.csv.
